    what_is_community:
      text3: We believe in saying things out loud. To act. To get practical and down
        to earth. In a time when many have thoughts and few act, and many have things,
        space and ideas that they want to keep to themselves or their group - we want
        to spin the world the other way around. We want to spin our heads, open our
        arms and share. Openly and freely. And we invite you to join in everything
        we do, from the smallest dance move to holding a speech of your own. Giving
        as much as you want and is able to, to make this Fest together with us. As
        a community.
      text2: 'For this second OuiShare Fest, we want to gather as many communities
        as we can and see what happens: collaborative consumers, makers, crowdfunders,
        digital & alternative currencies enthusiasts, open knowledge activists… For
        3 days, we will live together, think together, dance together. We want these
        days to mean something, to be the starting point of new projects and collaborations
        to build a common vision of a sustainable future.'
      text1: 'We must find out together. This is the whole point of the OuiShare Fest.
        But here’s our guess : any group of people who share an interest and values.
        In a way, you may think: such communities have always existed. And you would
        be right. What has changed then ? People scattered all around the world now
        have the ability to connect and to interact on a regular basis. These people
        are not isolated anymore. Communities are not exclusive from each other, and
        you may yourself be part of several communities at the same time.'

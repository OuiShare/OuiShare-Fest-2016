          To make this a truly collaborative experience, the festival will feature 3 days of interactive sessions in 4 areas, mixing traditional formats such as keynotes, panels and Q & Asâ€™ with participative formats such as unpanels, co-creation workshops, networking sessions, and many more you have never heard of.

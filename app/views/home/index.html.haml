      About
    %p 
      %b OuiShare Fest 14  will explore the "Age of Communities":  
      Connected by shared values, knowledge, resources, or by digital and physical spaces, communities are transforming cities, organizations and civic action everywhere in the world.

      What is a community?

    %p
      We must find out together. This is the whole point of the OuiShare Fest. But here’s our guess : any group of people who share an interest and values. In a way, you may think: such communities have always existed. And you would be right. What has changed then ? People scattered all around the world now have the ability to connect and to interact on a regular basis. These people are not isolated anymore. Communities are not exclusive from each other, and you may yourself be part of several communities at the same time. 
    %br
    %p
      For this second OuiShare Fest, we want to gather as many communities as we can and see what happens: collaborative consumers, makers, crowdfunders, digital & alternative currencies enthusiasts, open knowledge activists… For 3 days, we will live together, think together, dance together. We want these days to mean something, to be the starting point of new projects and collaborations to build a common vision of a sustainable future.
    %br
    %p
      We believe in saying things out loud. To act. To get practical and down to earth. In a time when many have thoughts and few act, and many have things, space and ideas that they want to keep to themselves or their group - we want to spin the world the other way around. We want to spin our heads, open our arms and share. Openly and freely. And we invite you to join in everything we do, from the smallest dance move to holding a speech of your own. Giving as much as you want and is able to, to make this Fest together with us. As a community.
